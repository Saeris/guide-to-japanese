Astro looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/learn/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its sub-path name.

Each file in the `pages/` directory maps to a url path starting from the site origin: `https://jp.saeris.gg/`. For example, `https://jp.saeris.gg/learn/grammar` maps to `src/pages/learn/grammar.astro`, which renders the content of `src/content/learn/grammar/introduction.md`. For all other routes within the `src/content/learn/grammar/` directory, a special "catch-all" page `src/pages/learn/[...slug].astro` will render the remainder of those files.

Each page uses a layout from the `src/layouts/` directory, which in turn is a composition of individual regions which are defined as components in the `src/components/` directory. Depending on the needs of each, a page, layout, or component may define it's own `<style>` or `script>` tags to extend the specific styling or interactivity requirements of each. Otherwise, site-wide styles such as the shared theme are defined in the `src/styles/` directory.

Images can be added to an `images/` folder in the same directory as a page file and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, fonts, etc, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

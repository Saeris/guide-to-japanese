# Negative Verbs

Now that we’ve seen how to declare things and perform actions with verbs, we want to be able to say the negative. In other words, we want to say that such-and-such action was not performed. This is done by conjugating the verb to the negative form just like the state-of-being for nouns and adjectives. However, the rules are a tad more complicated.

We will now make use of the verb classifications we learned in the last section to define the rules for conjugation. But before we get into that, we need to cover one very important exception to the negative conjugation rules: ""ある"".

- ある (u-verb) – to exist (inanimate)
- いる (ru-verb) – to exist (animate)

""ある"" is an u-verb used to express existence of inanimate objects. The equivalent verb for animate objects (such as people or animals) is ""いる"", which is a normal ru-verb. For example, if you wanted to say that a chair is in the room, you would use the verb ""ある"", but if you wanted to say that a person is in the room, you must use the verb ""いる"" instead. These two verbs ""ある"" and ""いる"" are quite different from all other verbs because they describe existence and are not actual actions. You also need to be careful to choose the correct one based on animate or inanimate objects.

Anyway, the reason I bring it up here is because the negative of ""ある"" is ""ない"" (meaning that something does not exist). The conjugation rules for all other verbs are listed below as well as a list of example verbs and their negative forms.

> [!Tip] Conjugation rules for negative verbs
>
> - **For ru-verbs:** Drop the ""る"" and attach ""ない""  
>   Example: {食|た}べ~~る~~ + ない = {食|た}べ==ない==
>
> - **＊For u-verbs that end in ""う"":** Replace ""う"" with ""わ"" and attach ""ない""  
>   Example: {買|か}~~う~~ + わ + ない = {買|か}==わない==
>
> - **For all other u-verbs:** Replace the u-vowel sound with the a-vowel equivalent and attach ""ない""  
>   Example: {待|ま}~~つ~~ + た = {待|ま}==たない==
>
> - **Exceptions:**  
>   する → しない  
>   くる → こない  
>   ＊ある → ない

In this section, we will learn some new particles essential for using verbs. We will learn how to specify the direct object of a verb and the location where a verb takes place whether it’s physical or abstract.

## The direct object ""を"" particle

### Vocabulary

++{魚|さかな}++
: fish

++{食べる|た・べる}++ <abbr title="る verb">ru-verb</abbr>
: to eat

++{ジュース|jyu u su}++
: juice

++{飲む|の・む}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to drink

++{街|まち}++

++ぶらぶら++
: wandering; aimlessly

++{歩く|ある・く}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to walk

++{高速|こう・そく}++
: high-speed

++{道路|どう・ろ}++
: route

++{走る|はし・る}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to run

++{毎日|まい・にち}++
: everyday

++{日本語|に・ほん・ご}++
: Japanese (language)

++{勉強|べん・きょう}++

: register

The first particle we will learn is the object particle because it is a very straightforward particle. The ""を"" character is attached to the end of a word to signify that that word is the direct object of the verb. This character is essentially never used anywhere else. That is why the katakana equivalent ""ヲ"" is almost never used since particles are always written in hiragana. The ""を"" character, while technically pronounced as _/wo/_ essentially sounds like _/o/_ in real speech. Here are some examples of the direct object particle in action.

#### Examples

1. {魚|さかな}==を=={食べる|た・べる}。  
   Eat fish.

1. {ジュース|jyu u su}==を=={飲|の}んだ。  
   Drank juice.

Unlike the direct object we’re familiar with in English, places can also be the direct object of motion verbs such as ""{歩|ある}く"" and ""{走|はし}る"". Since the motion verb is done to the location, the concept of direct object is the same in Japanese. However, as you can see by the next examples, it often translates to something different in English due to the slight difference of the concept of direct object.

1. {街|まち}==を==ぶらぶら{歩く|ある・く}。  
   Aimlessly walk through town. (Lit: Aimlessly walk town)

1. {高速|こう・そく}{道路|どう・ろ}==を=={走る|はし・る}。  
   Run through expressway. (Lit: Run expressway)

When you use ""する"" with a noun, the ""を"" particle is optional and you can treat the whole [noun + する] as one verb.

1. {毎日|まい・にち}、{日本語|に・ほん・ご}を=={勉強|べん・きょう}する==。  
   Study Japanese everyday.

1. {メールアドレス|me e ru a do re su}を=={登録|とう・ろく}した==。  
   Registered email address.

## The target ""に"" particle

### Vocabulary

++{日本|に・ほん}++
: Japan

++{行く|い・く}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to go

++{家|1) うち; 2) いえ}++
: one’s own home;<br/>house

++{帰る|かえ・る}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to go home

++{部屋|へ・や}++
: room

++{来る|く・る}++ <span>exception</span>
: to come

++{アメリカ|a me ri ka}++
: America

++{宿題|しゅく・だい}++
: homework

++{今日|きょう}++
: today

++{明日|あした}++
: tomorrow

++{猫|ねこ}++
: cat

++いる++ <abbr title="る verb">ru-verb</abbr>
: to exist (animate)

++いす++
: chair

++{台所|だい・どころ}++
: kitchen

++ある++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to exist (inanimate)

++いい++ <abbr title="い adjective">i-adj</abbr>
: good

++{友達|とも・だち}++
: friend

++{会う|あう}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to meet

++{医者|い・しゃ}++
: doctor

++なる++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to become

++{先週|せん・しゅう}++
: last week

++{図書館|と・しょ・かん}++
: library

++{来年|らい・ねん}++
: next year

The ""に"" particle can specify a target of a verb. This is different from the ""を"" particle in which the verb does something to the direct object. With the ""に"" particle, the verb does something toward the word associated with the ""に"" particle. For example, the target of any motion verb is specified by the ""に"" particle.

#### Examples

1. {ボブ|bo bu}は{日本|に・ほん}==に=={行|いき}った。  
   Bob went to Japan.

1. {家|うち}==に=={帰|かえ}らない。  
   Not go back home.

1. {部屋|へ・や}==に==くる。  
   Come to room.

As you can see in the last example, the target particle always targets “to” rather than “from”. If you wanted to say, “come from” for example, you would need to use ""から"", which means “from”. If you used ""に"", it would instead mean “come to“. ""から"" is also often paired with ""まで"", which means “up to”.

1. {アリス|a ri su}は、{アメリカ|a me ri ka}==から==きた。  
   Alice came from America.

1. {宿題|しゅく・だい}を{今日|きょう}==から=={明日|あした}==まで==する。  
   Will do homework from today to tomorrow.

The idea of a target in Japanese is very general and is not restricted to motion verbs. For example, the location of an object is defined as the target of the verb for existence （ある and いる）. Time is also a common target. Here are some examples of non-motion verbs and their targets

1. {猫|ねこ}は{部屋|へ・や}==に==いる。  
   Cat is in room.

1. いすが{台所|だい・どころ}==に==あった。  
   Chair was in the kitchen.

1. いい{友達|とも・だち}==に=={会|あ}った。  
   Met good friend.

1. {ジム|ji mu}は{医者|い・しゃ}==に==なる。  
   Jim will become doctor.

1. {先週|せん・しゅう}==に=={図書館|と・しょ・かん}==に=={行|いき}った。  
   Went to library last week.

Note: Don’t forget to use ""ある"" for inanimate objects such as the chair and ""いる"" for animate objects such as the cat.

While the ""に"" particle is not always required to indicate time, there is a slight difference in meaning between using the target particle and not using anything at all. In the following examples, the target particle makes the date a specific target emphasizing that the friend will go to Japan at that time. Without the particle, there is no special emphasis.

1. {友達|とも・だち}は、{来年|らい・ねん}、{日本|に・ほん}に{行く|い・く}。  
   Next year, friend go to Japan.

1. {友達|とも・だち}は、{来年|らい・ねん}==に=={日本|に・ほん}に{行く|い・く}。  
   Friend go to Japan next year.

## The directional ""へ"" particle

### Vocabulary

++{日本|に・ほん}++
: Japan

++{行く|い・く}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to go

++{家|1) うち; 2) いえ}++
: one’s own home;<br/>house

++{帰る|かえ・る}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to go home

++{部屋|へ・や}++
: room

++{来る|く・る}++ <span>exception</span>
: to come

++{医者|い・しゃ}++
: doctor

++なる++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to become

++{勝ち|か・ち}++
: victory

++{向かう|むか・う}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to face; to go towards

While ""へ"" is normally pronounced _/he/_, when it is being used as a particle, it is always pronounced _/e/_ （え）. The primary difference between the ""に"" and ""へ"" particle is that ""に"" goes to a target as the final, intended destination (both physical or abstract). The ""へ"" particle, on the other hand, is used to express the fact that one is setting out towards the direction of the target. As a result, it is only used with directional motion verbs. It also does not guarantee whether the target is the final intended destination, only that one is heading towards that direction. In other words, the ""に"" particle sticks to the destination while the ""へ"" particle is fuzzy about where one is ultimately headed. For example, if we choose to replace ""に"" with ""へ"" in the first three examples of the previous section, the nuance changes slightly.

#### Examples

1. {ボブ|bo bu}は{日本|に・ほん}==へ=={行|いき}った。  
   Bob ==headed towards== Japan.

1. {家|うち}==へ=={帰|かえ}らない。  
   Not go home ==toward== house.

1. {部屋|へ・や}==へ==くる。  
   Come ==towards== room.

Note that we cannot use the ""へ"" particle with verbs that have no physical direction. For example, the following is incorrect.

- {医者|い・しゃ}~~へ~~なる。  
   (Grammatically incorrect version of ""{医者|い・しゃ}になる"".)

This does not mean to say that ""へ"" cannot set out towards an abstract concept. In fact, because of the fuzzy directional meaning of this particle, the ""へ"" particle can also be used to talk about setting out towards certain future goals or expectations.

- {勝ち|か・ち}==へ=={向|む}かう。  
   Go towards victory.

## The contextual ""で"" particle

### Vocabulary

++{映画館|えい・が・かん}++
: movie theatre

++{見る|み・る}++ <abbr title="る verb">ru-verb</abbr>
: to see

++{バス|ba su}++
: bus

++{帰る|かえ・る}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to go home

++{レストラン|re su to ra n}++
: restaurant

++{昼ご飯|ひる・ご・はん}++
: lunch

++{食べる|た・べる}++ <abbr title="る verb">ru-verb</abbr>
: to eat

++{何|なに／なん}++
: what

++{暇|ひま}++
: free 　(as in not busy)

The ""で"" particle will allow us to specify the context in which the action is performed. For example, if a person ate a fish, where did he eat it? If a person went to school, by what means did she go? With what will you eat the soup? All of these questions can be answered with the ""で"" particle. Here are some examples.

#### Examples

1. {映画館{映画館|えい・が・かん}}==で=={見|み}た。  
   Saw at movie theater.

1. {バス|ba su}==で=={帰る|かえ・る}。  
   Go home by bus.

1. {レストラン|re su to ra n}==で=={昼ご飯|ひる・ご・はん}を{食|た}べた。  
   Ate lunch at restaurant.

It may help to think of ""で"" as meaning “by way of”. This way, the same meaning will kind of translate into what the sentence means. The examples will then read: “Saw by way of movie theater”, “Go home by way of bus”, and “Ate lunch by way of restaurant.”

## Using ""で"" with ""{何|なに}""

The word for “what” （{何|なに}） is quite annoying because while it’s usually read as ""なに"", sometimes it is read as ""なん"" depending on how it’s used. And since it’s always written in Kanji, you can’t tell which it is. I would suggest sticking with ""なに"" until someone corrects you for when it should be ""なん"". With the ""で"" particle, it is read as ""なに"" as well. (Hold the mouse cursor over the word to check the reading.)

1. {何|なに}==で==きた？  
   Came by the way of what?

1. {バス|ba su}==で==きた。  
   Came by the way of bus.

Here’s the confusing part. There is a colloquial version of the word “why” that is used much more often than the less colloquial version ""どうして"" or the more forceful ""なぜ"". It is also written as ""{何|なん}で"" but it is read as ""なんで"". This is a completely separate word and has nothing to do with the ""で"" particle.

1. =={何|なん}で==きた？  
   Why did you come?

1. {暇|ひま}だから。  
   Because I am free (as in have nothing to do).

The ""から"" here meaning “because” is different from the ""から"" we just learned and will be covered later in the compound sentence section. Basically the point is that the two sentences, while written the same way, are read differently and mean completely different things. Don’t worry. This causes less confusion than you think because 95% of the time, the latter is used rather than the former. And even when ""なにで"" is intended, the context will leave no mistake on which one is being used. Even in this short example snippet, you can tell which it is by looking at the answer to the question.

## When location is the topic

### Vocabulary

++{学校|がっ・こう}++
: school

++{行く|い・く}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to go

++{図書館|と・しょ・かん}++
: library

++どこ++
: where

++{イタリア|i ta ri a}++
: Italy

++{レストラン|re su to ra n}++
: restaurant

++どう++
: how

There are times when the location of an action is also the topic of a sentence. You can attach the topic particle （""は"" and ""も""） to the three particles that indicate location （""に""、""へ""、""で""） when the location is the topic. We’ll see how location might become the topic in the following examples.

#### Example 1

> {ボブ|bo bu} <small>Bob</small>
> : {学校|がっ・こう}に{行|い}った？  
> : (Did you) go to school?
>
> {アリス|a ri su} <small>Alice</small>
> : {行|い}かなかった。  
> : Didn’t go.
>
> {ボブ|bo bu} <small>Bob</small>
> : {図書館|と・しょ・かん}==には==？  
> : What about library?
>
> {アリス|a ri su} <small>Alice</small>
> : {図書館|と・しょ・かん}==にも=={行|い}かなかった。  
> : Also didn’t go to library.

In this example, Bob brings up a new topic (library) and so the location becomes the topic. The sentence is actually an abbreviated version of ""{図書館|と・しょ・かん}には{行|い}った？"" which you can ascertain from the context.

#### Example 2

> {ボブ|bo bu} <small>Bob</small>
> : どこで{食べる|た・べる}？  
> : Eat where?
>
> {アリス|a ri su} <small>Alice</small>
> : {イタリア|i ta ri a}{レストラン|re su to ra n}==では==どう？  
> : How about Italian restaurant?

Bob asks, “Where shall we eat?” and Alice suggests an Italian restaurant. A sentence like, “How about…” usually brings up a new topic because the person is suggesting something new. In this case, the location (restaurant) is being suggested so it becomes the topic.

## When direct object is the topic

### Vocabulary

++{日本語|に・ほん・ご}++
: Japanese (language)

++{習う|なら・う}++ <abbr title="う verb">u-verb</abbr>
: to learn

The direct object particle is different from particles related to location in that you cannot use any other particles at the same time. For example, going by the previous section, you might have guessed that you can say ""をは"" to express a direct object that is also the topic but this is not the case. A topic can be a direct object without using the ""を"" particle. In fact, putting the ""を"" particle in will make it wrong.

#### Examples

1. {日本語|に・ほん・ご}==を=={習う|なら・う}。  
   Learn Japanese.

1. {日本語|に・ほん・ご}==は==、{習う|なら・う}。  
   About Japanese, (will) learn it.

Please take care to not make this mistake.

- {日本語|に・ほん・ご}~~をは~~、{習う|なら・う}。  
   (This is incorrect.)

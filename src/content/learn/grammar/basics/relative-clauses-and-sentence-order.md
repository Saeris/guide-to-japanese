## Treating verbs and state-of-being like adjectives

Have you noticed how, many forms of verbs and the state-of-being conjugate in a similar manner to i-adjectives? Well, that is because, in a sense, they are adjectives. For example, consider the sentence: “The person who did not eat went to bank.” The “did not eat” describes the person and in Japanese, you can directly modify the noun ‘person’ with the clause ‘did not eat’ just like a regular adjective. This very simple realization will allow us to modify a noun with any arbitrary verb phrase!

## Using state-of-being clauses as adjectives

</div>

The negative, past, and negative past conjugations of verbs can be used just like adjectives to directly modify nouns. However, we <u>cannot</u> do this with the plain non-past state-of-being using ""だ"". (I told you this was a pain in the butt.) The language has particles for this purpose, which will be covered in the next section.

> [!Caution]
>
> You cannot use ""だ"" to directly modify a noun with a noun
> like you can with ""だった""、""じゃない""、and ""じゃなかった"".

You can, however, have a string of nouns placed together when they’re not meant to modify each other. For example, in a phrase such as “International Education Center” you can see that it is just a string of nouns without any grammatical modifications between them. It’s not an “Education Center that is International” or a “Center for International Education”, etc., it’s just “International Education Center”. In Japanese, you can express this as simply ""{国際|こく・さい}{教育|きょう・いく}{センター|se n ta a}"" (or ""{センター|se n ta a}""). You will see this chaining of nouns in many combinations. Sometimes a certain combination is so commonly used that it has almost become a separate word and is even listed as a separate entry in some dictionaries. Some examples include: ""{登場|とう・じょう}{人物|じん・ぶつ}""、""{立入|たち・いり}{禁止|きん・し}""、or ""通勤手当"". If you have difficulties in figuring out where to separate the words, you can paste them into the WWWJDICs [Translate Words in Japanese Text](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jwb/wwwjdic?9T) function and it’ll parse the words for you (most of the time).

### Examples

Here are some examples of direct noun modifications with a conjugated noun clause. The noun clause has been highlighted.

1. =={学生|がく・せい}じゃない=={人|ひと}は、{学校|がっ・こう}に{行|い}かない。  
   Person who is not student do not go to school.

1. =={子供|こ・ども}だった=={アリス|a ri su}が{立派|りっ・ぱ}な{大人|おとな}になった。  
   The Alice that was a child became a fine adult.

1. =={友達|とも・だち}じゃなかった=={アリス|a ri su}は、いい{友達|とも・だち}になった。  
   Alice who was not a friend, became a good friend.

1. =={先週|せん・しゅう}{医者|い・しゃ}だった=={ボブ|bo bu}は、{仕事|し・ごと}を{辞|や}めた。  
   Bob who was a doctor last week quit his job.

Now that we’ve learned the concept of relative clauses and how they are used as building blocks to make sentences, I can go over how Japanese sentence ordering works. There’s this myth that keeps floating around about Japanese sentence order that continues to plague many hapless beginners to Japanese. Here’s how it goes.

The most basic sentence structure in English can be described as consisting of the following elements in this specific order: [Subject] [Verb] [Object]. A sentence is not grammatically correct if any of those elements are missing or out of order.

Japanese students will tell you that Japanese, on the other hand, while frothing at the mouth, is completely backwards!! Even some Japanese teacher might tell you that the basic Japanese sentence order is [Subject] [Object] [Verb]. This is a classic example of trying to fit Japanese into an English-based type of thinking. Of course, we all know (right?) that the real order of the fundamental Japanese sentence is: [Verb]. Anything else that comes before the verb doesn’t have to come in any particular order and nothing more than the verb is required to make a complete sentence. In addition, the verb must always come at the end. That’s the whole point of even having particles so that they can identify what grammatical function a word serves no matter where it is in the sentence. In fact, nothing will stop us from making a sentence with [Object] [Subject] [Verb] or just [Object] [Verb]. The following sentences are all complete and correct because the verb is at the end of the sentence.

### Grammatically complete and correctly ordered sentences

1. {私|わたし}は{公園|こう・えん}で{お弁当|お・べん・とう}を=={食べる|た・べる}==。

1. {公園|こう・えん}で{私|わたし}は{お弁当|お・べん・とう}を=={食べる|た・べる}==。

1. {お弁当|お・べん・とう}を{私|わたし}は{公園|こう・えん}で=={食べる|た・べる}==。

1. {弁当|べん・とう}を=={食べる|た・べる}==。

1. =={食べる|た・べる}==。

So don’t sweat over whether your sentence is in the correct order. Just remember the following rules.

> [!Tip] Japanese sentence order
>
> A complete sentence requires a main verb that must come at the end. This also includes the implied state-of-being.
>
> **Examples:**
>
> 1.  食べた
> 1.  学生（だ）
>
> Complete sentences (relative clauses) can be used to modify nouns to make sentences with nested relative clauses except in the case of ""だ"".
>
> **Example:**
>
> - ==お弁当を食べた==学生が公園に行った。  
>   ==Student who ate lunch== went to the park.

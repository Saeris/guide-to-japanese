## How to get your way in Japan

We will now learn how to say what you want either by just coming out and saying it or by making discreet suggestions. The major topics we will cover will be the ""たい"" conjugation and the volitional form. We will also learn specialized uses of the ""たら"" and ""ば"" conditionals to offer advice.

## Verbs you want to do with ""たい""

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{行く|い・く}++
: to go <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{何|なに}++
: what

++する++
: to do <sup>(exception)</sup>

++{温泉|おん・せん}++
: hotspring

++{ケーキ|ke e ki}++
: cake

++{食べる|た・べる}++
: to eat <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++ずっと++
: long; far

++{一緒|いっ・しょ}++
: together

++いる++
: to exist (animate) <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{犬|いぬ}++
: dog

++{遊ぶ|あそ・ぶ}++
: to play <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

</div>

You can express verbs that you want to perform with the ""たい"" form. All you need to do is add ""たい"" to the stem of the verb. However, unlike most conjugations we learned where the verb turns into a ru-verb, this form actually transforms the verb into an i-adjective (notice how ""たい"" conveniently ends in ""い""). This makes sense because the conjugated form is a description of something that you want to do. Once you have the ""たい"" form, you can then conjugate it the same as you would any other i-adjective. However, the ""たい"" form is different from regular i-adjectives because it is derived from a verb. Particles we normally associate with verbs such as ""を""、""に""、""へ""、or ""で"" can all be used with the ""たい"" form in addition to the particles commonly used with regular adjectives such as ""は"" and ""が"".

|          |   Positive   |     Negative     |
| -------: | :----------: | :--------------: |
| Non-Past |   行きたい   |   行きたくない   |
|     Past | 行きたかった | 行きたくなかった |

Table: ""たい"" conjugations

### Examples

1. 何を==したい==ですか。  
   What do you want to do?

1. 温泉に==行きたい==。  
   I want to go to hot spring.

1. ケーキ、==食べたくない==の？  
   You don’t want to eat cake?

1. ==食べたくなかった==けど==食べたく==なった。  
   I didn’t want to eat it but I became wanting to eat.

Example 4 was very awkward to translate but is quite simple in Japanese if you refer to the section about using ""なる"" with i-adjectives”. The past tense of the verb ""なる"" was used to create “became want to eat”. Here’s a tongue twister using the negative ""～たくない"" and past-tense of ""なる""： ""食べたくなくなった"" meaning “became not wanting to eat”.

This may seem obvious but ""ある"" cannot have a ""たい"" form because inanimate objects cannot want anything. However, ""いる"" can be used with the ""たい"" form in examples like the one below.

- ずっと一緒に==いたい==。  
  I want to be together forever. (lit: Want to exist together for long time.)

Also, you can only use the ""たい"" form for the first-person because you cannot read other people’s mind to see what they want to do. For referring to anyone beside yourself, it is normal to use expressions such as, “I think he wants to…” or “She said that she wants to…” We will learn how to say such expressions in a later lesson. Of course, if you’re asking a question, you can just use the ""たい"" form because you’re not presuming to know anything.

- 犬と==遊びたい==ですか。  
   Do you want to play with dog?

## Indicating things you want or want done using ""欲しい""

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{欲しい|ほ・しい}++
: wanted; desirable <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{好き|す・き}++
: likable; desirable <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

++{大きい|おお・きい}++
: big <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{縫いぐるみ|ぬ・いぐるみ}++
: stuffed doll

++{全部|ぜん・ぶ}++
: everything

++{食べる|た・べる}++
: to eat <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{部屋|へ・や}++
: room

++きれい++
: pretty; clean <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

</div>

In English, we employ a verb to say that we want something. In Japanese, “to want” is actually an i-adjective and not a verb. We saw something similar with ""好き"" which is an adjective while “to like” in English is a verb. While I didn’t get too much into the workings of ""好き"", I have dedicated a whole section to ""欲しい"" because it means, “to want something done” when combined with the te-form of a verb. We will learn a more polite and appropriate way to make requests in the “Making Requests” lesson instead of saying, “I want this done.”

Though not a set rule, whenever words come attached to the te-form of a verb to serve a special grammatical function, it is customary to write it in hiragana. This is because kanji is already used for the verb and the attached word becomes part of that verb.

### Examples

1. 大きい縫いぐるみが==欲しい==！  
   I want a big stuffed doll!

1. 全部==食べてほしい==んだけど・・・。  
   I want it all eaten but…

1. 部屋をきれいに==してほしい==のよ。  
   It is that I want the room cleaned up, you know.

Like I mentioned, there are more appropriate ways to ask for things which we won’t go into until later. This grammar is not used too often but is included for completeness.

The term volitional here means a will to do something. In other words, the volitional form indicates that someone is setting out to do something. In the most common example, this simply translates into the English “let’s” or “shall we?” but we’ll also see how this form can be used to express an effort to do something in a lesson further along.

To conjugate verbs into the volitional form for casual speech, there are two different rules for ru-verbs and u-verbs. For ru-verbs, you simply remove the ""る"" and add ""よう"". For u-verbs, you replace the _/u/_ vowel sound with the _/o/_ vowel sound and add ""う"".

> [!Note] Conjugation rules for the casual volitional form
>
> **For ru-verbs:** Remove the ""る"" and add ""よう""
>
> Example: 食べ~~る~~ → 食べ + ++よう++ → 食べよう
>
> **For u-verbs:** Replace the / u / vowel sound with the / o / vowel sound and add ""う""
>
> Example: 入~~る~~ → 入==ろ== + ++う++ → 入ろう

Here is a list of verbs you should be used to seeing by now.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 1ch;"><div>

|   Plain    |  Volitional  |
| :--------: | :----------: |
| 食べ==る== | 食べ==よう== |
|  着==る==  |  着==よう==  |
| 信じ==る== | 信じ==よう== |
|  寝==る==  |  寝==よう==  |
| 起き==る== | 起き==よう== |
|  出==る==  |  出==よう==  |
| 掛け==る== | 掛け==よう== |
| 捨て==る== | 捨て==よう== |
| 調べ==る== | 調べ==よう== |

</div></div>

### Examples

I doubt you will ever use ""死のう"" (let’s die) but I left it in for completeness. Here are some more realistic examples.

1. 今日は何を==しよう==か？  
   What shall (we) do today?

1. テーマパークに==行こう==！  
   Let’s go to theme park!

1. 明日は何を==食べよう==か？  
   What shall (we) eat tomorrow?

1. カレーを==食べよう==！  
   Let’s eat curry!

Remember, since you’re setting out to do something, it doesn’t make sense to have this verb in the past tense. Therefore, there is only one tense and if you were to replace ""明日"" in the third example with, let’s say, ""昨日"" then the sentence would make no sense.

## Making a motion to do something using the volitional form (polite)

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{食べる|た・べる}++
: to eat <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{入る|はい・る}++
: to enter <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++する++
: to do <sup>(exception)</sup>

++{来る|く・る}++
: to come <sup>(exception)</sup>

++{寝る|ね・る}++
: to sleep <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{行く|い・く}++
: to go <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{遊ぶ|あそ・ぶ}++
: to play <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{今日|きょう}++
: today

++{何|なに}++
: what

++{テーマパーク|te e mu pa a ku}++
: theme park

++{明日|あした}++
: tomorrow

++{カレー|ka re e}++
: curry

</div>

The conjugation for the polite form is even simpler. All you have to do is add ""～ましょう"" to the stem of the verb. Similar to the masu-form, verbs in this form must always come at the end of the sentence. In fact, all polite endings must always come at the end and nowhere else as we’ve already seen.

> [!Note] Conjugation rules for the polite volitional form
>
> **For all verbs:** Add ""～ましょう"" to the stem of the verb
>
> 1. 食べ~~る~~ → 食べ + ++ましょう++ → 食べましょう
> 1. 入~~る~~ → 入==り== + ++ましょう++ → 入りましょう

| Plain |    Volitional    |
| :---: | :--------------: |
| する  |  し==ましょう==  |
| くる  |  き==ましょう==  |
| 寝る  |  寝==ましょう==  |
| 行く  | 行き==ましょう== |
| 遊ぶ  | 遊び==ましょう== |

Table: Sample verbs

### Examples

Again, there’s nothing new here, just the polite version of the volitional form.

1. 今日は何を==しましょう==か？  
   What shall (we) do today?

1. テーマパークに==行きましょう==！  
   Let’s go to theme park!

1. 明日は何を==食べましょう==か？  
   What shall (we) eat tomorrow?

1. カレーを==食べましょう==！  
   Let’s eat curry!

## Making Suggestions using the ""ば"" or ""たら"" conditional

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{銀行|ぎん・こう}++
: bank

++{行く|い・く}++
: to go <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++たまに++
: once in a while

++{両親|りょう・しん}++
: parents

++{話す|はな・す}++
: to speak <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

</div>

You can make suggestions by using the ""ば"" or ""たら"" conditional and adding ""どう"". This literally means, “If you do [X], how is it?” In English, this would become, “How about doing [X]?” Grammatically, there’s nothing new here but it is a commonly used set phrase.

### Examples

1. 銀行に==行ったらどう==ですか。  
   How about going to bank?

1. たまにご両親と==話せばどう==？  
   How about talking with your parents once in a while?

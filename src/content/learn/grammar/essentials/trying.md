## Let’s try some stuff

In English, we use the word, “try” to mean both “to try something out” and “to make an effort to do something”. In Japanese, these are separate grammatical expressions. For instance, “I tried the cherry flavor” and “I tried to do homework” mean quite different things and though English does not make a distinction, Japanese does.

To try something out, you simply need to change the verb to the te-form and add ""みる"". If it helps you to remember, you can think of it as a sequence of an action and then seeing the result. In fact ""みる"" conjugates just like ""見る"". However, just like the ""～てほしい"" grammar we learned, this is a set phrase and ""みる"" is usually written in hiragana.

We already learned that the volitional form was used to indicate a will to set out to do something. If you guessed that this next grammar for attempting to do something would involve the volitional form, you were right. To say that you tried (as in attempted) to do something, you need to conjugate the verb into the volitional, enclose it in a quotation (so that we can perform an action on the clause) and finally add the verb ""する"". Or put more simply, you just add ""とする"" to the volitional form of the verb. This is simply an extension of the quoted relative clause from the last section. Instead of saying the quote （言う） or treating it as a thought （思う、考える）, we are simply doing it with ""する"".

### Examples

1. 毎日、勉強を==避けようとする==。  
   Everyday, she attempts to avoid study.

1. 無理矢理に部屋に==入ろうとしている==。  
   He is attempting to force his way into the room.

1. 早く==寝ようとした==けど、結局は徹夜した。  
   I attempted to sleep early but ended up staying up all night.

1. お酒を==飲もうとした==が、奥さんが止めた。  
   He tried to drink alcohol but his wife stopped him.

Though we use the verb ""する"" to say, “to do attempt”, we can use different verbs to do other things with the attempt. For instance, we can use the verb ""決める"" to say, “decide to attempt to do [X]”. Here are some examples of other actions carried out on the attempt.

1. 勉強をなるべく避けようと==思った==。  
   I thought I would attempt to avoid studying as much as possible.

1. 毎日ジムに行こうと==決めた==。  
   Decided to attempt to go to gym everyday.

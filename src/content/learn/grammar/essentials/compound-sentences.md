In this section, we will learn various ways to combine multiple simple sentences into one complex sentence. For example, we will learn how to chain separate sentences together to express multiple actions or states. In other words, if we have two simple sentences with the same subject, “I ran” and “I ate”, we will learn how to group them together to mean, “I ran and ate.” We will also learn how to do this with adjectives and nouns. (Ex: He is rich, handsome, and charming.)

## Expressing a sequence of states

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{一般的|いっ・ぱん・てき}++
: in general

++{静か|しず・か}++
: quiet <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

++{狭い|せま・い}++
: narrow <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{彼女|かの・じょ}++
: she; girlfriend

++いい++
: good <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{私|わたし}++
: me; myself; I

++{部屋|へ・や}++
: room

++きれい++
: pretty; clean <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

++とても++
: very

++{好き|す・き}++
: likable; desirable <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

++{学生|がく・せい}++
: student

++{先生|せん・せい}++
: teacher

++{田中|た・なか}++
: Tanaka (last name)

++{お金持ち|お・かね・も・ち}++
: rich

++かっこいい++
: cool; handsome <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{魅力的|み・りょく・てき}++
: charming

</div>

It is very easy to combine a chain of nouns and adjectives to describe a person or object. For example, in English if we wanted to say, “He is X. He is Y. He is Z.” since all three sentences have the same noun, we would usually say, “He is X, Y, and Z.” In Japanese, we can do the same thing by conjugating the noun or adjective. The last noun or adjective remains the same as before.

> [!Note] How to chain nouns and adjectives together
>
> **For nouns and na-adjectives:** Attach ""で"" to the noun or na-adjective.
>
> Examples
>
> 1.  一般的 → 一般的++で++
> 1.  静か → 静か++で++
>
> **For i-adjectives and negative noun/adjectives:** Replace the ""い"" with ""くて"".
>
> <small>(For ""いい"" and ""かっこいい"", the ""い→よ"" exception applies here as well.)</small>
>
> Examples
>
> 1. 狭~~い~~ → 狭++くて++
> 1. 彼女じゃな~~い~~ → 彼女じゃな++くて++
> 1. ~~いい~~ → ++よくて++

### Examples

1. 私の部屋は、きれい==で==、静か==で==、とても好き。  
   My room is clean, quiet, and I like it a lot.
1. 彼女は、学生じゃな==くて==、先生だ。  
   She is not a student, she is a teacher.
1. 田中さんは、お金持ち==で==、かっこ==よくて==、魅力的ですね。  
   Tanaka-san is rich, handsome, and charming, isn’t he?

As you can see, the ""で"" attached to ""お金持ち"" obviously cannot be the context particle ""で"" here because there is no verb. It might be helpful to think of ""で"" as merely a substitution for ""だ"" that can be chained together.

## Expressing a sequence of verbs with the te-form

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{学生|がく・せい}++
: student

++{買う|か・う}++
: to buy <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{食べる|た・べる}++
: to eat <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{行く|い・く}++
: to go <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++する++
: to do <sup>(exception)</sup>

++{遊ぶ|あそ・ぶ}++
: to play <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{飲む|の・む}++
: to drink <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{食堂|しょく・どう}++
: cafeteria

++{昼ご飯|ひる・ご・はん}++
: lunch

++{昼寝|ひる・ね}++
: afternoon nap

++{時間|じ・かん}++
: time

++ある++
: to exist (inanimate) <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{映画|えい・が}++
: movie

++{見る|み・る}++
: to see <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

</div>

In a similar fashion, you can express multiple actions. It is usually interpreted as a sequence of event. (I did [X], then I did [Y], then I finally did [Z].) There are two forms: positive and negative. The tense of all the actions is determined by the tense of the last verb.

> [!Note] How to chain verbs together
>
> **Positive:** Conjugate the verb to its past tense and replace ""た"" with ""て"" or ""だ"" with ""で"". This is often called the **_te-form_** even though it could sometimes be ‘de’.
>
> **Negative:** Same as i-adjectives, replace ""い"" with ""くて"". This rule also works for the polite ""です"" and ""ます"" endings.
>
> Examples
>
> 1. 学生で~~す~~ → 学生==でし==~~た~~ → 学生でし++て++
> 1. 買いま~~す~~ → 買い==まし==~~た~~ → 買いまし++て++

| Past Tense |  Te-form   |   Negative   |    Te-form     |
| :--------: | :--------: | :----------: | :------------: |
| 食べ==た== | 食べ==て== | 食べな==い== | 食べな==くて== |
| 行っ==た== | 行っ==て== | 行かな==い== | 行かな==くて== |
|  し==た==  |  し==て==  |  しな==い==  |  しな==くて==  |
| 遊ん==だ== | 遊ん==で== | 遊ばな==い== | 遊ばな==くて== |
| 飲ん==だ== | 飲ん==で== | 飲まな==い== | 飲まな==くて== |

You can connect two complete sentences using ""から"" to indicate a reason for something. The two sentences are always ordered [reason] から [result]. When the reason is a non-conjugated noun or na-adjective, you ==must== add ""だ"" to explicitly declare the reason in the form of ""(noun/na-adjective)==だ==から"". If you forget to add the declarative ""だ"" to ""から"", it will end up sounding like the ""から"" meaning “from” which was first introduced in the section on particles, earlier.

### Examples

1. 時間がなかった==から==パーティーに行きませんでした。  
   There was no time so didn’t go to party.
1. 友達==から==プレゼントが来た。  
   Present came ==from== friend.
1. 友達==だから==プレゼントが来た。  
   Present came ==because== (the person is) friend. (This sentence sounds a bit odd.)

Either the reason or the result can be omitted if it is clear from the context. In the case of polite speech, you would treat ""から"" just like a regular noun and add ""です"".

### Example 1

> <cite>田中さん：</cite> どうしてパーティーに行きませんでしたか。  
> <cite>Tanaka-san:</cite> Why didn’t you go to the party?
>
> <cite>山田さん：</cite> 時間がなかった==から==です。  
> <cite>Yamada-san:</cite> It’s because I didn’t have time.

### Example 2

> <cite>一郎：</cite> パーティーに行かなかったの？  
> <cite>Ichiro:</cite> You didn’t go to the party?
>
> <cite>直子：</cite> うん、時間がなかった==から==。  
> <cite>Naoko:</cite> Yeah, because I didn’t have time.

### Example 3

When you omit the reason, you must include the declarative ""だ"" or ""です"".

> <cite>直子：</cite> 時間がなかった。  
> <cite>Naoko:</cite> I didn’t have time.
>
> <cite>一郎：</cite> ==だから==パーティーに行かなかったの？  
> <cite>Ichiro:</cite> Is that why you didn’t go to the party?

Notice that we could have also used the explanatory ""の"" to express the same thing. In other words, 山田さん could have also said, ""時間がなかったのです"" or ""時間がなかったんです"" while 直子 could have said ""時間がなかったの"" (we’ll assume she wants to use the more feminine form).

In fact, this is where ""ので"" possibly came from. Let’s say you want to combine two sentences: ""時間がなかったのだ"" and ""パーティーに行かなかった"". Remember we can treat the ""の"" just like a noun so we can use what we just learned in the first section of this lesson. 時間がなかったのだ＋パーティーに行かなかった becomes: 時間がなかった==ので==パーティーに行かなかった。 In fact, ""ので"" is almost interchangeable with ""から"" with a few subtle differences. ""から"" explicitly states that the sentence preceding is the reason for something while ""ので"" is merely putting two sentences together, the first with an explanatory tone.

This is something I call causation where [X] happened, therefore [Y] happened. This is slightly different from ""から"" where [Y] happened explicitly because [X] happened. This difference tends to make ""ので"" sound softer and slightly more polite and it is favored over ""から"" when explaining a reason for doing something that is considered discourteous.

- ちょっと忙しい==ので==、そろそろ失礼します。  
   Because I’m a little busy, I’ll be making my leave soon.

<small>（""失礼します"", which literally means “I’m doing a discourtesy”, is commonly used as a polite way to make your leave or disturb someone’s time.）</small>

> [!Tip] Reminder:
>
> Don’t forget that the explanatory ""の"" requires a ""な"" for both non-conjugated nouns and na-adjectives. Review Particles 3 to see why.

1. 私は学生==な==ので、お金がないんです。  
   Because I’m a student, I have no money (lit: there is no money).
1. ここは静か==な==ので、とても穏やかです。  
   It is very calm here because it is quiet.
1. ==な==ので、友達に会う時間がない。  
   That’s why there’s no time to meet friend.

Just like how the explanatory ""の"" can be shortened to ""ん"", in speech, the ""ので"" can be changed to ""んで"" simply because it’s easier to slur the sounds together rather than pronouncing the / o / syllable.

1. 時間がなかった==んで==パーティーに行かなかった。  
   Didn’t go to the party because there was no time.
1. ここは静かな==んで==、とても穏やかです。  
   It is very calm here because it is quiet.
1. ==なんで==、友達に会う時間がない。  
   That’s why there’s no time to meet friend.

## Using ""のに"" to mean “despite”

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{毎日|まい・にち}++
: everyday

++{運動|うん・どう}++
: exercise

++する++
: to do <sup>(exception)</sup>

++{全然|ぜん・ぜん}++
: not at all (when used with negative)

++{痩せる|や・せる}++
: to become thin <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{学生|がく・せい}++
: student

++{彼女|かの・じょ}++
: she; girlfriend

++{勉強|べん・きょう}++
: study

</div>

Grammatically, ""のに"" is used exactly the same way as ""ので"". When used to combine two simple sentences together, it means “[Sentence 1] despite the fact that [Sentence 2].” However the order is reversed: [Sentence 2]のに[Sentence 1].

### Examples

1. 毎日運動した==のに==、全然痩せなかった。  
   Despite exercising every day, I didn’t get thinner.
1. 学生な==のに==、彼女は勉強しない。  
   Despite being a student, she does not study.

## Expressing contradiction using ""が"" and ""けど""

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++{デパート|de pa a to}++
: department store

++{行く|い・く}++
: to go <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{何|なに／なん}++
: what

++{全然|ぜん・ぜん}++
: not at all (when used with negative)

++{欲しい|ほ・しい}++
: desirable <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{友達|とも・だち}++
: friend

++{聞く|き・く}++
: to ask; to listen <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{知る|し・る}++
: to know <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{今日|きょう}++
: today

++{暇|ひま}++
: free　(as in not busy)

++{明日|あした}++
: tomorrow

++{忙しい|いそが・しい}++
: busy <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{彼|かれ}++
: he; boyfriend

++まだ++
: yet

++{好き|す・き}++
: likable; desirable <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

++いい++
: good <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{物|もの}++
: object

++たくさん++
: a lot (amount)

++ある++
: to exist (inanimate)

++{見る|み・る}++
: to see <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{面白い|おも・しろ・い}++
: interesting <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

</div>

Used in the same manner as ""から"" and ""ので"", ""が"" and ""けど"" also connect two sentences together but this time to express a contradiction. Just like ""から"" the declarative ""だ"" is required for nouns and na-adjectives. And just like ""から"" and ""ので"", either part of the contradiction can be left out.

### Examples

1. デパートに行きました==が==、何も欲しくなかったです。  
   I went to department store but there was nothing I wanted.
1. 友達に聞いた==けど==、知らなかった。  
   I asked (or heard from) a friend but he (or I) didn’t know.
1. 今日は暇==だけど==、明日は忙しい。  
   I’m free today but I will be busy tomorrow.
1. ==だけど==、彼がまだ好きなの。  
   That may be so, but it is that I still like him. [explanation, feminine tone]

It may seem odd but ""聞く"" can either mean “to listen” or “to ask”. You may think this may become confusing but the meaning is usually clear within context. In the second example, we’re assuming that the friend didn’t know, so the speaker was probably asking the friend.

Yet again we see the importance of context in Japanese because this sentence can also mean, “I heard from a friend but I didn’t know” since there is neither subject nor topic. Similar to the difference between ""ので"" and ""から"", ""が"" has a softer tone and is slightly more polite than ""けど"".

Though this isn’t a rule as such, it is generally common to see ""が"" attached to a ""～ます"" or ""～です"" ending and ""けど"" attached to a regular, plain ending. A more formal version of ""けど"" is ""けれど"" and even more formal is ""けれども"", which we may see later when we cover formal expressions.

Unlike the English word for contradiction such as “but” or “however”, ""けど"" and ""が"" do not always express a direct contradiction. Often times, especially when introducing a new topic, it is used as a general connector of two separate sentences.

For example, in the following sentences, there is no actual contradiction but ""が"" and ""けど"" are used simply to connect the sentences. Sometimes, the English “and” becomes a closer translation than “but”.

1. デパートに行きました==が==、いい物がたくさんありました。  
   I went to the department store and there was a lot of good stuff.
1. マトリックスを見た==けど==、面白かった。  
   I watched the “Matrix” and it was interesting.

## Expressing multiple reasons using ""し""

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++どうして++
: why

++{友達|とも・だち}++
: friend

++{先生|せん・せい}++
: teacher

++{年上|とし・うえ}++
: older

++{彼|かれ}++
: he; boyfriend

++{好き|す・き}++
: likable <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

++{優しい|やさ・しい}++
: gentle; kind <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++かっこいい++
: cool; handsome <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{面白い|おも・し・ろい}++
: interesting <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

</div>

When you want to list reasons for multiple states or actions you can do so by adding ""し"" to the end of each relative clause. It is very similar to the ""や"" particle except that it lists reasons for verbs and state-of-being. Again, for states of being, ""だ"" must be used to explicitly declare the state-of-being for any non-conjugated noun or na-adjective. Let’s look at some examples.

### Example 1

> <cite>Ａ：</cite> どうして友達じゃないんですか？  
> <cite>A:</cite> Why isn’t (he/she) friend [seeking explanation]?
>
> <cite>Ｂ：</cite> 先生==だし==、年上==だし==・・・。  
> <cite>B:</cite> Well, he’s/she’s the teacher, and older…

### Example 2

> <cite>Ａ：</cite> どうして彼が好きなの？  
> <cite>A:</cite> Why (do you) like him?
>
> <cite>Ｂ：</cite> 優しい==し==、かっこいい==し==、面白いから。  
> <cite>B:</cite> Because he’s kind, attractive, and interesting (among other things).

Notice that ""優しくて、かっこよくて、面白いから。"" could also have worked but much like the difference between the ""と"" and ""や"" particle, ""し"" implies that there may be other reasons.

## Expressing multiple actions or states using ""～たりする""

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++する++
: to do <sup>(exception)</sup>

++{食べる|た・べる}++
: to eat <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{飲む|の・む}++
: to drink <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{簡単|かん・たん}++
: simple <sup>(na-adj)</sup>

++{難しい|むずか・しい}++
: difficult <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{映画|えい・が}++
: movie

++{見る|み・る}++
: to see <sup>(ru-verb)</sup>

++{本|ほん}++
: book

++{読む|よ・む}++
: to read <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{昼寝|ひる・ね}++
: afternoon nap

++この++
: this （abbr. of これの）

++{大学|だい・がく}++
: college

++{授業|じゅ・ぎょう}++
: class

</div>

This is the verb version of the ""や"" particle. You can make an example list of verbs among a possible larger list by conjugating each verb into the past tense and adding ""り"". At the end, you need to attach the verb ""する"". Just like the ""や"" particle, the tense is determined by the last verb, which in this case will always be ""する"" (since you have to attach it at the end). You can also use this with the state-of-being to say that you are a number of things at various random times among a larger list. Similar to regular verbs, you just take the noun or adjective for each state-of-being and conjugate it to the past state-of-being and then attach ""り"". Then finally, attach ""する"" at the end.

> [!Note] Rules for stating a list of verbs among a larger list using ""～たりする""
>
> **For verbs:** Conjugate each verb to the past tense and add ""り"". Finally, add ""する"" at the very end.

> Example
>
> 食べ~~る~~、飲~~む~~ → 食べ++た++、飲++んだ++ → 食べた++り++、飲んだ++り++ → 食べたり、飲んだり++する++
>
> **For state-of-being:** Conjugate the noun or adjective for each state-of-being to the past tense and add ""り"". Finally, add ""する"" at the very end.
>
> Example
>
> 簡単、難し~~い~~ → 簡単++だった++、難し++かった++ → 簡単だった++り++、難しかった++り++ → 簡単だったり、難しかったり++する++

1. 映画を==見たり==、本を==読んだり==、==昼寝したり==する。  
   I do things like (among other things) watch movies, read books, and take naps.
1. この大学の授業は簡単==だったり==、==難しかったり==する。  
   Class of this college is sometimes easy, sometimes difficult (and other times something else maybe).

As you can see, the tense and negative/positive state is controlled by the last ""する"".

1. 映画を見たり、本を読んだり==した==。  
   I ==did== things like (among other things) watch movies, and read books.
1. 映画を見たり、本を読んだり==しない==。  
   I ==don’t do== things like (among other things) watch movies, and read books.
1. 映画を見たり、本を読んだり==しなかった==。  
   I ==didn’t do== things like (among other things) watch movies, and read books.

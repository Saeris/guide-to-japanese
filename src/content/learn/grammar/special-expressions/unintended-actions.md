This is the first of many useful tools that will become essential in your day-to-day conversations. We will now learn how to express an action that has taken place unintentionally often with unsatisfactory results. This is primarily done by the verb ""しまう"". Let’s look at an example.

++{宿題|しゅく・だい}++

</div>

When ""しまう"" is used in this sense, it is normal to attach it to the te-form of another verb to express an action that is done or happened unintentionally. As is common with this type of grammar, the tense is decided by the tense of ""しまう"".

1. そのケーキを全部==食べて==しまった。  
   Oops, I ate that whole cake.

1. 毎日ケーキを食べて、２キロ==太って==しまいました。  
   I ate cake everyday and I (unintentionally) gained two kilograms.

1. ちゃんと食べないと、==痩せて==しまいますよ。  
   If you don’t eat properly, you’ll (unintentionally) lose weight you know.

1. 結局、嫌なことを==させて==しまった。  
   In the end, I (unintentionally) made [someone] do something distasteful.

1. ごめん、==待たせて==しまって！  
   Sorry about (unintentionally) making you wait!

1. 金魚がもう==死んで==しまった。  
   The goldfish died already (oops).

## Using the casual version of ""～てしまう""

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++しまう++
: to do something by accident; to finish completely <sup>(na-adja)</sup>

++{金魚|きん・ぎょ}++
: goldfish

++もう++
: already

++{死ぬ|し・ぬ}++
: to die <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{帰る|かえ・る}++
: to go home <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++いい++
: good <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++{皆|みんな}++
: everybody

++どっか++
: somewhere （abbr. of どこか）

++{行く|い・く}++
: to go <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++そろそろ++
: gradually; soon

++{遅い|おそ・い}++
: late <sup>(i-adj)</sup>

++なる++
: to become <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++また++
: again

++{遅刻|ち・こく}++
: tardiness

++する++
: to do <sup>(exception)</sup>

++ごめん++
: sorry

++つい++
: just (now); unintentionally

++{お前|お・まえ}++
: you (casual)

++{呼ぶ|よ・ぶ}++
: to call <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

</div>

In casual speech, the ""～てしまう"" is often substituted by ""～ちゃう"" while ""～でしまう"" is substituted by ""じゃう"". Both ""～ちゃう"" and ""～じゃう"" conjugate just like regular u-verbs.

1. 金魚がもう死ん==じゃった==。  
   The goldfish died already.

1. もう帰っ==ちゃって==いい？  
   Is it ok if I went home already?

1. みんな、どっか行っ==ちゃった==よ。  
   Everybody went off somewhere.

1. そろそろ遅くなっ==ちゃう==よ。  
   It’ll gradually become late, you know.

There is yet another very colloquial version of ""～てしまう"" and ""～でしまう"" where it is replaced by ""～ちまう"" and ""～じまう"" respectively. Unlike the cuter ""～ちゃう"" and ""～じゃう"" slang, this version conjures an image of rough and coarse middle-aged man.

1. また遅刻==しちまった==よ。  
   Darn, I’m late again.

1. ごめん、ついお前を呼ん==じまった==。  
   Sorry, I just ended up calling you unconsciously.

## Another meaning of ""しまう""

### Vocabulary

<div class="columns">

++しまう++
: to do something by accident; to finish completely <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

++{宿題|しゅく・だい}++
: homework

++やる++
: to do <sup>(u-verb)</sup>

</div>

You may have noticed that ""しまう"" has another definition meaning “to finish something completely”. You may want to consider this a totally separate verb from the ""しまう"" we have covered so far. Occasionally but not usually, ""しまう"" will have this meaning rather than the unintended action.

- 宿題をやってしまいなさい。  
   Finish your homework completely.
